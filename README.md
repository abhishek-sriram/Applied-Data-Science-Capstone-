# SpaceX Falcon-9 Landing Prediction
### _Predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after rocket launch_.

In this project, I developed a model to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than the 165 million dollars charged by other providers. This substantial cost reduction is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting the landing success of the first stage, we can better estimate the overall launch costs. This analysis is particularly useful for companies looking to compete with SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.

### Data collection with Webscraping and Data wrangling
#### _Objectives_
* Wrote Python code to manipulate data within a Pandas DataFrame.

* Wrote Python code to manipulate data within a Pandas DataFrame.

* Created a Jupyter notebook and shared it via GitHub.

* Applied data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.

* Utilized data analysis tools to load, clean, and extract insights from the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites, converting it into a DataFrame for further data wrangling and analysis.

#### _Objectives_

* Created scatter plots and bar charts using Python to analyze data within a Pandas DataFrame.
  
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) by writing Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
  
* Executed SQL queries to select and sort data.
  
* Employed data visualization techniques to extract meaningful patterns that guide the modeling process.

### Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards

Developed a dashboard to interactively analyze launch records using Plotly Dash and built an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity with the Folium Python library.

#### _Objectives_

* Built an interactive dashboard featuring pie charts and scatter plots using Plotly Dash.
  
* Calculated distances on an interactive map using Python code with the Folium library.
  
* Generated interactive maps, plotted coordinates, and marked clusters using Python code with the Folium library.
  
* Created a dashboard to interactively analyze launch records with Plotly Dash.
  
* Developed an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity with Folium.

### Predictive Analysis(Classification)

In this module, I used machine learning to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. The data was split into training and testing sets to identify the best hyperparameters for SVM, classification trees, and logistic regression, and then evaluated the best-performing method on the test data.

#### _Objectives_

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
  
* Trained various classification models.
  
* Conducted hyperparameter grid search.
  
* Applied machine learning skills to build a predictive model to enhance business efficiency.
